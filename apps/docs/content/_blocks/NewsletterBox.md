# NewsletterBox

A NewsletterBox supports a typical e-commerce newsletter subscription process.

In this example there are two types of alerts: `positive` and `negative`. The first one is shown when a valid email address is passed to the input and submitted. The second one shows up when there already was submitted exactly the same email address.
