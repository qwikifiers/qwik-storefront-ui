# Order Summary

An order summary shows all order details into a consolidated view. Your customers can easily add a promo code to their order and the change will be visible immediately after applying a valid code.

<!--
In this example there are two types of alerts: `positive` and `error`.

The first one is shown in two cases:

- when a valid promo code - `VSF2023` is passed to the input and applied by clicking on the `Apply` button,
- when added promo code has been removed.

The second alert shows up when passed promo code is not valid.
 -->

:::tip
In order to apply valid promo code use: `VSF2023`.
